## Building SCSS files
In order to build the .scss files which generate the minified `main.css` used for custom stylesheets of our brand and website, run the `npm run sass` command.

But in the process of development and testing, one may want to watch the Sass files for changes and have them automatically compile to the `main.css` file. In order to do this, run the `npm run sass:watch` command.

## Git commit guidelines
The commit message formatting can be added using a typical git workflow or through the use of a CLI wizard (Commitizen). To use the wizard, run `npm run commit` in your terminal after staging your changes in git.
